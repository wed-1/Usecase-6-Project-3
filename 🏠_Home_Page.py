## CONGRATULATIONS! For graduating from the top academy for Data Science!

##### Pretty nice getting all those job offers ha? Better go back and thank the academy, especially your instructors! But wait‚Ä¶ all offers are in Riyadh? Interviewers are asking if you live in Riyadh?

Oh, now it‚Äôs getting real..

Yeah‚Ä¶ Yeah we know‚Ä¶ it's time to seriously consider moving, and finding a place to stay in Riyadh is a bit annoying (might be an understatement) and it doesn‚Äôt help that whenever you go online to find something you just get bombarded by so many options, or none! 

And you‚Äôre probably thinking ‚ÄúWouldn‚Äôt it be nice if someone just picked something for me? Or at least help me decide? I need an expert‚Ä¶‚Äù 

Well look no more! We did the search for you!

See Riyadh, just like any city, is split into multiple regions:

Now all you have to do is consider transportation.

If you‚Äôre a practical person and prices don‚Äôt matter to you, you would want to be near your workplace.

Or if you‚Äôre a person that spends wisely, and transportation is not a concern, then we recommend finding a place in the more affordable areas, like **{insert example based on the charts}**.

Everything you just saw, can be found at **{website}**, and their offers cover all regions of Riyadh.

Feels great doesn't it? No more worry about where and what to pick. We‚Äôre glad we could help!

Take a look at the below list of scenarios, and hopefully one of them could be a great fit for you!

Wishing you all the best in your future endeavors!
